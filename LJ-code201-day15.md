#Project Week

still dealing with broken tooth.  It will be taken care of next Monday.  Had a wonderful weekend watching championship roller derby and spending time with a s00per special friend.  Also spent Saturday with the kids.  No school work completed, and I accept this as I was able to truly be relaxed this weekend with family and friends.
